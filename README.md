### Example Configuration

```yaml
github:
  primary_account:
    username: "your-primary-username"
    token: "${GITHUB_PRIMARY_TOKEN}"
  secondary_account:
    username: "your-secondary-username"
    token: "${GITHUB_SECONDARY_TOKEN}"

achievements:
  pull_shark:
    enabled: true
    target_count: 1024
  quickdraw:
    enabled: true
  # ... more achievements
```

## Usage

Run the achievement hunter:

```bash
python -m github_achievement_hunter.main
```

### Command Line Options

```bash
# Run specific achievements only
python -m github_achievement_hunter.main --achievements pull_shark,quickdraw

# Dry run mode (no actual API calls)
python -m github_achievement_hunter.main --dry-run

# Resume from previous progress
python -m github_achievement_hunter.main --resume
```

## Progress Tracking

The tool automatically saves progress to `progress.json` and can resume from interruptions. Progress includes:

- Completed achievements
- Current counts for each achievement
- Last successful operation timestamps

## Rate Limiting

The tool respects GitHub's API rate limits:
- Implements exponential backoff
- Batches operations where possible
- Tracks remaining API calls
- Estimated completion time: ~20-30 hours for all achievements
