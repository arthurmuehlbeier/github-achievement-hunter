def main():
    # Load configuration
    config = load_config()
    
    # Initialize GitHub clients
    primary_client = GitHubClient(config.primary_account)
    secondary_client = GitHubClient(config.secondary_account)
    
    # Initialize progress tracker
    tracker = ProgressTracker(config.progress_file)
    
    # Run achievement hunters
